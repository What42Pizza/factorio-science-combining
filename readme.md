# Science Combining

![thumbnail](thumbnial.png)

This is a factorio mod that allows you to combine science packs into higher-tier science packs. It is meant to enable early stress testing of in-process megabases, allowing you to fully use up your current science production before all science builds are finished.

If you think that any recipe is too easy or too hard or if you'd like me to add compatibility for a mod, just open an issue and I'll probably tweak / add it

The recipes for the base game are:

- 3 x previous tier + 1 x current tier -> 2 x current tier

The recipes for the space age dlc are:

- 20 x space age + 1 x [any planet's science pack] -> 2 x [any planet's science pack]
- 10 x metallurgic + 10 x electromagnetic + 10 x agricultural + 10 x cryogenic + 1 x promethium -> 2 x promethium
